]
.right-column[
A11yFirst promotes a new model of proactive editing for the creation of
accessible content.
* The old model of remediation is not as effective.

  - Accessibility checkers typically provide a laundry list of problems,
    in no particular order.

  - Going through the list and “fixing” the problems typically does not provide
    learning experiences that help people better understand accessibility.

  - “After the fact” checking for accessibility problems can be forgotten
    too easily.

* Because “timing is everything!”

  - For example, the best time to add alt. text for an image is when its
    purpose is clear and you can more easily answer the question: “What
    information does _this_ image provide in _this_ particular context?”

  - Image

  - Table

The bottom row includes common action features such as:

  - Undo / Redo &amp; Cut / Copy / Paste

  - Apply Character Styling

  - Insert Special Character

  - Set Language

## Heading / Paragraph

* Headings are promoted to the top of the menu

* All heading menu items are styled the same to reinforce their use as structural elements

* Heading menu item labels indicate purpose

* Based on cursor position in the document, only headings that
  are in sequence can be selected

* Paragraph formats: Normal, Preformatted text, Address line

Additional configuration options:

* Allow only one ```h1``` (true or false)

* No gaps allowed (```h1;h2;h4``` results in ```h1, h2, h3, h4```)
