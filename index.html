## A11yFirst for CKEditor

### Why should I be using it?

A11yFirst for CKEditor promotes a new model of _proactive.red[*] editing_ for
the creation of accessible content.

### Why was a new model needed?

* If the goal is helping authors understand how to make their content
  accessible, the reactive model of fixing problems after they happen is not
  as effective.

  - Accessibility checkers typically provide a laundry list of problems
    that need to be fixed.

  - Going through the list and “fixing” the problems typically does not provide
    learning experiences that help people better understand accessibility.

  - When running the checker is the last step in the process, it's too easy to
    forget (or skip altogether).

* Because timing is important!

  - For example, the best time to add alt. text for an image is when its
    purpose is clear and you can more easily answer the question: “What
    information does _this_ image provide in _this_ particular context?”

## Toolbar Reorganized

### What problem is it trying to solve?

The user interface / toolbar of most WYSIWYG editors communicates to its users:

* “What your document looks like is all that matters!” (WRONG!!!)

We are trying to counter that with a toolbar design that communicates that
features related to structure are not only about visual styling.

When elements such as headings and lists are used, screen readers convey their
semantics. For example:

* "Heading level 3: [heading content]"
* "List with 5 items; item number 1: [list item content]"

Block elements come first; visual styling is an alternative when there is no
better choice.
---
## Heading / Paragraph

### Headings

* Only headings that are in sequence are enabled

* Menu items are styled the same to reinforce their use as structural elements

* Menu item labels indicate purpose

### Configuration options:

* Allow only one `h1` (true or false)

* Gaps are ignored (`h1;h2;h4` results in `h1, h2, h3, h4`)
---
## Heading / Paragraph

### Paragraph formats

* Normal

* Preformatted text

* Address line

* Normal (DIV)

### Menu / Button

* Located in the first position of the first row of the toolbar

* Provides a Help menu item

exclude: false
## Heading / Paragraph

### Why use it?

* Headings are important — they make it easier for all readers to understand
  the structure of your document.

* Headings allow screen reader users to quickly and easily navigate from one
  section of your document to another.

* Using headings sequentially avoids unnecessary confusion.

   For example, understanding the context of a ‘Level 3’ heading, when there
   is no corresponding ‘Level 2’ heading preceding it, can be very confusing.
---
## Character Style

Based on the CKEditor Styles plugin:

* Eliminates block styles

* Configured with same syntax as Styles

### Menu / Button

* Located in the bottom row of the toolbar (for de-emphasis)

* Provides a Help menu item
---
## Character Style

### Why use it?

When visual styling is used in place of structural elements such as heading or
list markup, important semantic information that helps screen reader users
understand your content is missing from your document.
---
## A11yFirst Link

Based on the CKEditor Link plugin:

* Does not default to using the URL as the Display Text

* Does not allow empty Display Text

* Requires confirmation when a URL is used as the Display Text

* Detects the use of nondescriptive words and phrases such as ‘click here,’
  ‘more’ et al.

### Dialog box

* Provides a Help button
---
## A11yFirst Link

### Why use it?

* Display text should describe the target of the link.

* URLs are typically not very descriptive when used as display text.
---
## A11yFirst Image

Based on the CKEditor Image2 plugin:

* Prompts for Alternative Text

* Warns when Alt. Text is more than 100 char. in length

* Detects Alt. Text words and phrases such as ‘image of,’ ‘photo of’ et al.

* Detects use of file name or size in Alt. Text

* For a decorative image, allows the user to indicate that Alt. Text
  is not required

* Asks the user whether a Long Description is needed, and if so, where
  it will be located in the document

### Dialog box

* Provides a Help button
---
## A11yFirst Image

### Why use it?

* People with visual impairments need text descriptions of informative images.

* An informative image must at least have alternative text so that a screen
  reader can briefly describe the information it conveys.

* Alternative text should be succinct and should not include redundant or
  irrelevant information.

* A complex informative image should have a long description in the document,
  adjacent to the image.

* An image that is purely decorative should have an empty `alt` attribute,
  which tells the screen reader to ignore it. Thus there should be a way to
  indicate that an image is decorative.
