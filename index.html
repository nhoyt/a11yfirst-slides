A11yFirst for CKEditor promotes a new model of _proactive.red[*] editing_ for
the creation of accessible content.

Why was a new model needed?

* If the goal is helping authors understand how to make their content
  accessible, the reactive model of fixing problems after they happen is not
  as effective.

  - Accessibility checkers typically provide a laundry list of problems
    that need to be fixed.

  - Going through the list and “fixing” the problems typically does not provide
    learning experiences that help people better understand accessibility.

  - When running the checker is the last step in the process, it's too easy to
    forget (or skip altogether).

* Because timing is important!

  - For example, the best time to add alt. text for an image is when its
    purpose is clear and you can more easily answer the question: “What
    information does _this_ image provide in _this_ particular context?”

.right-column[
## Heading / Paragraph

1. It is important to use headings to demarcate and label the structure of your
   document.

   This allows screen reader users to quickly and easily navigate from one
   section to another.

1. Headings should be used sequentially.

   For example, understanding the context of a `Level 3` heading, when there is no
   corresponding `Level 2` heading, can be very confusing.

## A11yFirst Image

1. People with visual impairments need text descriptions of informative images.

1. Each informative image must at least have alternative text.

1. Alternative text should be succinct and should not include redundant or
   irrelevant information.

1. An image that is purely decorative should have an empty `alt` attribute
   (thus there should be a way to indicate that an image is decorative).

1. A complex informative image should have a long description in the document,
   adjacent to the image.
