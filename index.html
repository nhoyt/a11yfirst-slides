A11yFirst promotes a new model of _proactive.red[*] editing_ for the creation
of accessible content.

Why was a new model needed?

* If the larger goal is helping authors better understand how to make their
  content accessible, the reactive model of remediation is not as effective.

  - Accessibility checkers typically provide a laundry list of problems
    that need to be fixed.

  - Going through the list and “fixing” the problems typically does not provide
    learning experiences that help people better understand accessibility.

  - It's too easy to forget (or skip) that last step of running the
    accessibility checker.

* Because “timing is everything!”

  - For example, the best time to add alt. text for an image is when its
    purpose is clear and you can more easily answer the question: “What
    information does _this_ image provide in _this_ particular context?”

## Heading / Paragraph

### Headings

* Promoted to the top of the menu

* Menu items are styled the same to reinforce their use as structural elements

* Menu item labels indicate purpose (e.g. ‘H2 – Section title’)

* Only headings that are in sequence are enabled

### Configuration options:

* Allow only one `h1` (true or false)

* Gaps are ignored (`h1;h2;h4` results in `h1, h2, h3, h4`)

## Heading / Paragraph

It is important to use headings to demarcate and label the structure of your
document.

* This allows screen reader users to quickly and easily navigate from one
  section to another.

Headings should be used sequentially.

* For example, if a screen reader user is trying to understand the context of
  a `Level 4` heading and/or its content, and there is no corresponding `Level
  3` heading, that can be confusing.

### Heading / Paragraph
### A11yImage
]
.right-column[
## A11yImage

* Prompts for Alternative Text

* Warns when Alt. Text is more than 100 char. in length

* Detects Alt. Text words and phrases such as ‘image of,’ ‘photo of’ et al.

* Detects use of file name or size in Alt. Text

* For a decorative image, allows the user to indicate that Alt. Text
  is not required

* Asks the user whether a Long Description is needed, and if so, where
  it will be located in the document

* Provides a Help button

.right-column[
## A11yImage

* People with visual impairments need text descriptions of informative images.

* Each informative image must at least have alternative text.

* Alternative text should be succinct and should not include redundant or
  irrelevant information.

* An image that is purely decorative should have an empty `alt` attribute
  (thus there should be a way to indicate that an image is decorative).

* A complex informative image should have a long description in the document,
  adjacent to the image.

The use case we are focused on is that of A11yFirst for CKEditor within a CMS
environment. Typically, CMS templates will control the following:

* Font face

* Font size

* Font color

This will foster stylistic consistency across the documents that constitute
the website, while enhancing accessibility by not allowing the above features
to be misused.
